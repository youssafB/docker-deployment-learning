Flask App CI/CD Pipeline and Dockerization Project

This project focuses on deploying a Flask application using a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline and Dockerization. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience in automating the software delivery process and deploying the application to the cloud.
Project Overview:
1. Flask App Deployment:

    Objective: Deploy a simple Flask application to understand the deployment process.
    Key Steps:
        Develop a basic Flask application.
        Set up a local environment for testing.

2. Dockerization:

    Objective: Containerize the Flask application using Docker.
    Key Steps:
        Create a Dockerfile to define the application's dependencies and settings.
        Build a Docker image for portability and consistency.

3. CI/CD Pipeline:

    Objective: Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
    Key Steps:
        Set up a CI/CD pipeline using popular tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
        Configure automated tests to ensure the application's integrity.
        Automate the deployment process to streamline updates.

4. Cloud Deployment:

    Objective: Deploy the Flask application on a cloud platform.
    Key Steps:
        Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
        Configure the cloud environment for deployment.
        Deploy the Dockerized Flask application to the cloud.

Project Structure:

    app/: Directory containing the Flask application code.
    Dockerfile: Definition file for building the Docker image.
    .github/workflows/: Directory containing CI/CD workflow configuration files (for GitHub Actions).
    scripts/: Directory for scripts related to deployment and automation.

Usage:

    Develop and test the Flask application locally in the app/ directory.
    Dockerize the application using the provided Dockerfile.
    Set up a CI/CD pipeline according to your preferred tool in the .github/workflows/ directory.
    Deploy the Dockerized Flask application to your chosen cloud platform.

Dependencies:

    Flask
    Docker
    Your preferred CI/CD tool (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)
    Cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.)
